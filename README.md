### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a PhD Candidate at IIM Ahmedabad, where I'm delving into Information Systems with a focus on their intersection with public policy and defense. My background in tech, from software engineering at Zycus to innovative projects in computer vision, fuels my research and my drive to solve complex problems through technology.

Iâ€™m passionate about data-driven decision making and am currently exploring how advanced analytics can be leveraged in strategic planning. If you're interested in collaborative projects or discussions in these areas, feel free to reach out!

Let's innovate and make an impact together!
